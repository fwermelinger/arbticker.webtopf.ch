# arbticker.webtopf.ch

http://arbticker.webtopf.ch is a small side project to keep track of historical arbitrage rate between two exchanges.

The purpose of this tool is to show current and recent arbitrage data between a Korean and foreign exchange. I chose Bithumb and Kraken because they're the ones I used the most. Data is fetched every few minutes and then aggregated into hourly data points.

This whole site is a constant work in progress. I do not guarantee the correctness of the data.
